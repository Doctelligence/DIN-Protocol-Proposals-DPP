# DIN Protocol Proposals (DPPs)

## Introduction

Welcome to the DIN Protocol Proposals (DPPs) repository! This repository is the central place where the DIN community collaborates on the evolution of the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN). DPPs are the primary mechanism for proposing improvements, new features, and changes to the DIN protocol.

## What is a DPP?

A DIN Protocol Proposal (DPP) is a design document providing information to the DIN community or describing a new feature for DIN or its processes or environment. The DPP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. DPPs are intended to be the foundation of the DIN development process, similar to Ethereum's EIPs.

**Note:** The DIN protocol does not employ coin voting for decision-making. Instead, we emphasize a more democratic and community-driven approach.

## DPP Categories

DPPs are categorized based on their impact and purpose:

- **Core DPPs:**  
  Core DPPs propose changes that affect the fundamental DIN protocol, such as modifications to consensus mechanisms, security protocols, or privacy-preserving techniques.

- **Interface DPPs:**  
  Interface DPPs define standards for interactions between different components within the DIN ecosystem. This includes protocols for data exchange, APIs, and communication standards between nodes.

- **Informational DPPs:**  
  Informational DPPs provide general guidelines, best practices, or other non-technical recommendations that do not directly alter the DIN protocol.

## Governance and Community Participation

In the spirit of digital democracy, DIN leverages tools like **gov4git** and **Polis** to empower community members and developers:

- **gov4git:**  
  Contributions to the DIN ecosystem are rewarded indefinitely based on participation in **gov4git**. Tokens earned through contributions can be allocated according to DPP proposals, and community members can engage in **quadratic voting** to prioritize the importance of these proposals. The most critical proposals will be highlighted to steer community and developer focus.

- **Polis:**  
  **Polis** is used for community discussions, especially on topics of high interest. There is no limit to how long a discussion can continue, allowing for in-depth exploration of ideas. This ensures that every voice in the community can be heard and that decisions are made collectively.

The DIN community is committed to an experimental and evolving governance process that reflects the values of digital democracy. Everyone is encouraged to participate in shaping the future of the protocol.

## DPP Lifecycle

1. **Draft:**  
   A new DPP is submitted as a draft. The proposal is discussed and revised with input from the community.

2. **Review:**  
   Once the draft has been refined, it enters the review stage, where it undergoes thorough evaluation by the DIN community and maintainers.

3. **Final:**  
   After successful review and approval, the DPP is marked as final and is implemented or adopted as part of the DIN protocol.

4. **Rejection/Withdrawal:**  
   A DPP can be rejected if it does not meet the necessary standards or if the community decides not to move forward with it. Authors can also withdraw a DPP at any stage before it becomes final.

## How to Contribute

We encourage community members to contribute to the evolution of the DIN protocol by submitting their own DPPs. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork this Repository:**  
   Start by forking this repository to create your own copy where you can draft your DPP.

2. **Create a New DPP File:**  
   Draft your proposal in a new markdown file. Follow the format of existing DPPs for consistency.

3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**  
   Once your DPP is ready, submit a pull request to this repository. Your proposal will be reviewed and discussed by the community.

4. **Engage in Discussions:**  
   Participate in the discussions and revisions of your DPP. Feedback from the community is crucial for refining and improving proposals.

## DPP Numbering

Each DPP is assigned a unique number (e.g., DPP-1, DPP-2) to help track and reference proposals. Please refer to the [DPP Index](./DPP-Index.md) for a list of all proposals.

## DPP Template

To ensure consistency, please use the following template when drafting a DPP:

```markdown
# DPP-<Number>: <Title>

**Authors:** <Your Name>  
**Status:** Draft / Review / Final / Rejected / Withdrawn  
**Category:** Core / Interface / Informational  
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary

A brief summary of the proposal.

## Abstract

A detailed description of the proposal, including the problem it addresses and the proposed solution.

## Motivation

Why is this proposal necessary? What problem does it solve, or what improvements does it bring?

## Specification

A technical description of the proposed changes or new features. This should be as detailed as possible.

## Rationale

Explain why the specific design decisions were made.

## Backwards Compatibility

Discuss how this proposal affects backwards compatibility with previous versions of the DIN protocol.

## Implementation

(Optional) Details on the implementation of the proposal, if applicable.

## References

(Optional) Include references to any related documents, research, or other DPPs.

# Conclusion
The DIN Protocol Proposals (DPPs) are essential for the collaborative development of the DIN ecosystem. We encourage everyone in the community to participate, share ideas, and help shape the future of decentralized intelligence.

Remember, this process is designed to be open-ended and driven by community input, reflecting our commitment to experimenting with new tools for communities to coordinate with each other. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.

Happy proposing!
